There are 4x4x4=64 physical LEDs, but since these are RGB, each physical bulb is actually 3 LEDs: R, G, and B, giving us a total of 192 LEDs! We also need to rapidly pulsing the R, G, and B channels at specific duty cycles in order to acheive proper color blending. But the Arduino Uno I was using only had 6 PWM pins! I ended up daisy chaining 3 TLC5940 LED drivers which gave me 48 dimmable constant-current sinks, but that is still only 1/4 of the pins I need to control all the lights. To get around this, I used Charlieplexing to light each 4x4 layer (which happens to contain 48 LEDS) separately at such a high speed that persistence-of-vision effects trick your eye into believing they're all lit at the same time. Combining this with PWM, though, was really hard..."
